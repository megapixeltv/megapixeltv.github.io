I love playing games. I just stream for fun because my newly built computer can handle streaming. I figured that since I'm already playing games, I might as well stream the games that I play.

I don't really have much else to write here, so I guess here are a list of games that I'm currently playing:
1. Need for Speed: Heat
    * I love this game. I had my doubts about the game because of EA and all, but this game is really fun.
2.  Warframe
	* I pretty much just log in daily to get the daily login bonus. I no longer play this game ever since I hate the melee 3.0 changes.

This site is to help clean up my info section for my stream. I feel that a quality change is needed for my stream to make it look clean. Removing text and moving it to this new site will help clean it up. If people want to see something from my info section they click what they want to see and it takes them to that page.

This site will receive a lot of changes once i figure this out. If you have any ideas or improvements please feel free to hit me up. I can always use help.

You can watch me stream at: {% include icon-twitch.html username="mega_pixel" %}

Or you can learn more [About Me]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %}).

Make sure to check out the rest of the website by using the navigation menu at the top right corner of the site for streaming schedules and friends.
